# GreenTrail Outdoors Store – Promotion Effectiveness Analysis

This project analyzes promotional performance for a fictional retailer, GreenTrail Outdoors, using raw store-level data. The goal was to evaluate which promotion types, store types, and store sizes deliver the strongest and most sustainable sales impact.

## Objectives
- Measure lift in sales, visits, and spend-per-visit (SPV) during promotions
- Assess post-promotion effects to detect halo vs. cannibalization
- Compare performance by promotion type (BOGO, Discount, Special Event)
- Compare performance by store type (Urban vs. Suburban) and store size

## Key Insights
- Special Events and Discounts deliver the strongest average sales lift.
- BOGO promotions show post-period underperformance, suggesting pull-forward/cannibalization.
- Urban stores act as traffic engines; Suburban stores drive higher SPV.
- Larger stores correlate positively with sales lift (r ≈ 0.62).

## Deliverables
- Written analysis report with:
  - Executive summary
  - Data snapshot and key metrics
  - Promotion-type and store-type comparisons
  - Outlier and anomaly identification
  - Test design and control strategy recommendations
- Presentation deck summarizing findings and recommendations for stakeholders.

## My Role
- Cleaned and analyzed the raw Excel dataset
- Calculated lift metrics and correlations
- Synthesized findings into an executive-ready report
- Designed a test-and-learn strategy and duration plan
