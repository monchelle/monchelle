# SQL Practice & Learning Projects

This folder contains my SQL exercises and practice queries as I strengthen my technical foundation in data analysis and database management. These scripts reflect hands‑on learning across multiple SQL concepts and mirror the types of queries used in real analytics and business intelligence work.

## What’s Included
- Querying and filtering data  
- Aggregations and summary statistics  
- JOINs across multiple tables  
- Subqueries and common table expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions and ranking  
- Data cleaning and transformation logic  
- Practice problems from courses, simulations, and self‑guided study  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing efficient, readable SQL  
- Breaking down business questions into structured queries  
- Using SQL to explore, clean, and analyze datasets  
- Applying analytical thinking to real‑world scenarios  
- Preparing for more advanced analytics workflows (SQL + Python + BI tools)

## Why This Matters
SQL is a core skill for data analysts, data scientists, and operations leaders. These exercises represent my ongoing commitment to building strong technical fluency and applying SQL to solve practical business problems.

## Next Steps
I will continue adding:
- More complex JOIN and CTE examples  
- Case‑study style SQL analyses  
- End‑to‑end workflows combining SQL with Python and visualization tools
