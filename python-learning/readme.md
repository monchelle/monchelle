# Python Practice & Learning Projects

This folder contains Python scripts I wrote while building my technical foundation in data analytics, automation, and problem‑solving. These exercises reflect my hands‑on learning process as I strengthen my skills for data‑driven leadership and future data science work.

## What’s Included
- Core Python fundamentals (loops, functions, conditionals)
- Data manipulation and logic exercises
- Early algorithm practice (e.g., run‑length encoding)
- Small automation and analysis scripts
- Exploratory work as I transition into more advanced analytics

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing clean, readable Python code
- Breaking down problems into logical steps
- Building and testing functions
- Applying algorithmic thinking
- Preparing for deeper work in data analysis and machine learning

## Why This Matters
These scripts represent the foundation of my technical growth. As I continue developing my analytics portfolio, this folder will evolve to include:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization projects
- Real‑world business analytics examples

## Next Steps
I will continue adding:
- Jupyter notebooks for data projects
- SQL + Python combined workflows
- Visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- End‑to‑end analytics case studies
