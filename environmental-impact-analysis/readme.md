# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis (1750–2022)

This project explores global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from 1750 to 2022 to identify long‑term trends, regional drivers, and the impact of industrialization on global emissions. The analysis was completed as part of an environmental data challenge for **Maven Environmental**, a U.S.-based non‑profit focused on climate research and public education.

The final deliverable is an **interactive Tableau Public dashboard** designed to help the public explore emissions patterns across time, countries, and economic development stages.

## 🧹 Data Profiling & Quality Assessment

Key checks performed:

- Verified continuous yearly data from 1750–2022  
- Confirmed geographic coverage across 200+ countries and territories  
- Identified missing values in early historical years  
- Checked for anomalies and outliers related to industrialization and global events  
- Validated region and country classifications  

---

## 🛠️ Data Preparation

Steps included:

- Standardizing and cleaning column names  
- Handling missing or inconsistent values  
- Creating derived fields (e.g., per‑capita emissions, cumulative emissions)  
- Reshaping data for time‑series and comparative analysis  
- Exporting a clean dataset for Tableau

## 🔍 Key Insights

- CO₂ emissions remained low until the Industrial Revolution, then accelerated rapidly.  
- The United States and Europe dominated emissions for over a century.  
- Since the 2000s, Asia—particularly China and India—has become the primary driver of global emissions growth.  
- Per‑capita emissions remain highest in developed economies.  
- The global emissions curve shows no sustained decline, underscoring the challenge of climate mitigation.
