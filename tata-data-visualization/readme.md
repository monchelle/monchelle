# Tata Data Visualization: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

This project was completed as part of the Tata Data Visualization job simulation. I was provided with raw Excel data and asked to create executive-ready visuals and insights for a CEO and CMO of a simulated retail company. The goal was to analyze revenue, customer behavior, and global demand to support strategic decision-making.

## Project Objectives

### 1. Monthly Revenue Time Series (2011)
The CEO requested a time-series view of monthly revenue for 2011 to identify seasonal patterns and support forecasting for the upcoming year.  
**Deliverable:** A monthly revenue line chart showing peaks, dips, and potential seasonal drivers.

### 2. Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK)
The CMO wanted to understand which countries generated the most revenue and how quantity sold compared across markets.  
**Deliverable:** A side-by-side bar chart showing revenue and quantity for the top 10 countries, excluding the United Kingdom.

### 3. Top 10 Customers by Revenue
The CMO requested a ranked view of the top 10 customers to identify high-value accounts and prioritize retention strategies.  
**Deliverable:** A descending bar chart showing revenue by customer ID.

### 4. Global Demand by Country (Excluding UK)
The CEO wanted a single-view map showing product demand across all countries to identify expansion opportunities.  
**Deliverable:** A filled map visual showing total quantity sold by country, excluding the United Kingdom.
