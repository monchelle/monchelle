# Grad School Plan – Master of Science in Data Science

This project outlines and manages my end‑to‑end journey toward earning a Master of Science in Data Science. Using Asana as the project‑management framework, I designed a structured roadmap that covers program research, funding strategy, enrollment preparation, and academic execution.

## Project Overview
The plan spans a 7‑month timeline and includes:
- Evaluating graduate program options and admissions requirements  
- Building a structured scholarship and financial‑aid pipeline  
- Mapping key milestones from application to enrollment  
- Tracking coursework, deadlines, and academic progress  
- Aligning long‑term goals with day‑to‑day execution

## Objectives
- Create a clear, actionable roadmap for completing my degree  
- Organize tasks, dependencies, and timelines using Asana  
- Maintain visibility into progress, risks, and resource needs  
- Demonstrate project‑management discipline and strategic planning  

## Tools & Methods
- **Asana** for task management, timelines, and progress tracking  
- **Milestone planning** for major academic and administrative checkpoints  
- **Kanban boards** for workflow visibility  
- **Goal tracking** to align short‑term tasks with long‑term outcomes  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Project planning and execution  
- Timeline and milestone management  
- Strategic decision‑making  
- Workflow design and organization  
- Use of Asana for complex, multi‑phase projects  

## Deliverables
- Asana project board with tasks, subtasks, and dependencies  
- Timeline view of the full 7‑month plan  
- Scholarship and funding pipeline  
- Coursework and milestone tracker
